                <h3>I'm a passionate and dedicated web developer that never wants to stop learning. 
                    Everything that I dive into, I do with an open heart and an open mind. As someone who
                    worked in fine dining for a decade, I have an appreciation for going above 
                    and beyond to create an extraordinary experience. Civil rights including but
                    not limited to lgbt rights, women's rights, and undocumented persons' rights
                    are a force that drives me to make this world a better place every day that
                    I'm living in it.  Many people never achieve anything great because 
                    they gave up to0 soon. I refuse to be one of them.

                </h3>
